# Practical_RL
A course on reinforcement learning in the wild.
Taught on-campus at [HSE](https://cs.hse.ru) and [YSDA](https://yandexdataschool.com/)  and maintained to be friendly to online students (both english and russian).


#### Manifesto:
* __Optimize for the curious.__ For all the materials that aren’t covered in detail there are links to more information and related materials (D.Silver/Sutton/blogs/whatever). Assignments will have bonus sections if you want to dig deeper.
* __Practicality first.__ Everything essential to solving reinforcement learning problems is worth mentioning. We won't shun away from covering tricks and heuristics. For every major idea there should be a lab that makes you to “feel” it on a practical problem.
* __Git-course.__ Know a way to make the course better? Noticed a typo in a formula? Found a useful link? Made the code more readable? Made a version for alternative framework? You're awesome! [Pull-request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) it!

* Online student __[survival guide](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/wiki/Online-student's-survival-guide)__
* Installing the libraries - [guide and issues thread](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/issues/1)
* Magical button that launches you into course environment: 
    * [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/yandexdataschool/Practical_RL/master) - comes will all libraries pre-installed. May be down time to time.
    * If it's down, try [__google colab__](https://colab.research.google.com/) or [__azure notebooks__](http://notebooks.azure.com/). Those last longer, but they will require you to run installer commands (see ./Dockerfile).
* Anonymous [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdurWw97Sm9xCyYwC8g3iB5EibITnoPJW2IkOVQYE_kcXPh6Q/viewform) for everything that didn't go through e-mail.
