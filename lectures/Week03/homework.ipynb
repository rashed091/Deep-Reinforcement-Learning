    "We will use the code you just wrote extensively in the next week of our course. If you're feeling that you need more examples to understand how experience replay works, try using it for binarized state spaces (CartPole or other __[classic control envs](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#classic_control)__).\n",

You can use Q-learning, SARSA and Experience Replay for any RL problems you want to solve - just thow 'em into a file and import the stuff you need."
